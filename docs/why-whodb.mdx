# Why Choose WhoDB?

**WhoDB is the modern database management tool that developers actually want to use.** Unlike bloated legacy tools, WhoDB delivers a lightning-fast, intuitive experience that makes working with databases enjoyable instead of frustrating.

## The Problem with Traditional Database Tools

Traditional database management tools like phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin, and others were built for a different era. They're:

- **Slow and Resource-Intensive**: Heavy desktop applications that consume gigabytes of RAM
- **Cluttered Interfaces**: Dozens of menus, toolbars, and options that hide what you actually need
- **Difficult to Learn**: Steep learning curves that waste hours of productive time
- **Poor Visualization**: Limited or non-existent schema visualization capabilities
- **Inconsistent Experience**: Different tools for different databases, each with unique quirks

<Warning>
The average developer wastes **2-3 hours per week** wrestling with database tools instead of building features.
</Warning>

## The WhoDB Difference

WhoDB was built from the ground up to solve these problems with a focus on **speed, simplicity, and developer experience**.
