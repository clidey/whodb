# AI-Powered Data Exploration

Exploring an unfamiliar database typically involves hours of reading documentation, writing test queries, and piecing together relationships. WhoDB's AI Chat Assistant transforms this time-consuming process into a natural conversation, allowing you to understand database structure, discover data patterns, and map relationships in minutes instead of hours.

<Tip>
This guide demonstrates a complete exploration workflow using AI to understand a new database from scratch
</Tip>

## The Challenge: Understanding Unfamiliar Databases

Database exploration presents significant challenges for everyone on your team:

### Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="New Developer Onboarding">
You join a project with a mature database containing 50+ tables. The documentation is outdated, and the senior developers are too busy to provide detailed walkthroughs. You need to understand:

- What entities exist and how they relate
- Where specific data lives
- Which tables are actively used vs. legacy
- What queries are safe to run

**Traditional Approach**: Spend days reading schema definitions, examining foreign keys, and writing exploratory queries
**Time Required**: 2-5 days to gain basic understanding
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Analyst Exploring Production">
Your business stakeholders need insights from a production database you've never seen. You need to quickly:

- Identify which tables contain relevant data
- Understand data quality and completeness
- Map relationships between customer, order, and product data
- Generate sample queries for reporting

**Traditional Approach**: Request schema documentation, create ERD diagrams, write dozens of test queries
**Time Required**: 1-3 days before you can produce meaningful analysis
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DBA Auditing a New System">
Your company acquired another business, and you need to assess their database. Critical questions include:

- How is data organized?
- Are there data quality issues?
- What are the relationships and dependencies?
- Where are the potential performance bottlenecks?

**Traditional Approach**: Generate schema reports, manually trace foreign keys, sample data from each table
**Time Required**: 2-4 days for comprehensive audit
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Consultant Analyzing Client Data">
You're working with a new client who needs database optimization. You have limited time to:

- Understand their data model
- Identify inefficient patterns
- Locate performance-critical tables
- Propose improvements

**Traditional Approach**: Schedule meetings with client DBA, review documentation, manually explore schema
**Time Required**: 1-2 days before you can provide recommendations
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Why Traditional Exploration is Slow

**Manual Query Writing**: Each question requires crafting SQL queries from scratch
```sql
-- Just to see what's in a table requires remembering syntax
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM users;
```

**Schema Navigation**: Finding relationships means manually tracing foreign keys through information schema tables

**Trial and Error**: Understanding data patterns requires multiple query iterations

**Context Switching**: Constantly switching between documentation, schema viewers, and query tools

## How AI Chat Assistant Accelerates Exploration

WhoDB's AI Chat Assistant eliminates these barriers by letting you explore databases through natural conversation:

## Complete AI Exploration Workflow

Let's walk through exploring a completely unfamiliar e-commerce database using only the AI Chat Assistant.

### Phase 1: Discovery - What Exists?

Start by understanding what's in the database at a high level.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open AI Chat">
Navigate to the Chat interface in WhoDB's sidebar.

![Chat Initial Page](/images/101-chat-initial-page.png)

The chat interface is ready for your questions.
</Step>

<Step title="Ask About Available Tables">
Start with the most fundamental question:

```text Natural Language Query
What tables are available in this database?
```

**AI Response**:
```text
Your database contains the following tables:
- users
- products
- categories
- orders
- order_items
- payments
- reviews
- shipping_addresses
- inventory
- wishlists
- promotions
```

![Simple Text Response](/images/105-chat-simple-text-response.png)

**What You Learn**: The database has 11 tables representing a typical e-commerce system with users, products, orders, and supporting features.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand Table Purposes">
Ask about specific tables to understand their role:

```text Follow-Up Questions
What does the orders table contain?
Describe the structure of the products table
What's in the order_items table?
```

**AI Response Examples**:
```text
The orders table contains customer purchase records including:
- Order ID (primary key)
- User ID (foreign key to users)
- Order date and status
- Total amount
- Shipping and billing information
```

**What You Learn**: Table purposes and high-level contents without viewing actual data yet.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Table Sizes">
Understand the scale of data:

```text Natural Language Query
How many rows are in each table?
```

**AI Response** (generates and executes query):
```
users: 15,234 rows
products: 8,567 rows
categories: 42 rows
orders: 45,123 rows
order_items: 128,456 rows
payments: 45,089 rows
reviews: 12,345 rows
shipping_addresses: 18,901 rows
inventory: 8,567 rows
wishlists: 3,456 rows
promotions: 156 rows
```

![SQL Query Results](/images/106-chat-sql-query-results.png)

**What You Learn**: The database contains moderate data volume. `order_items` is the largest table, which makes sense (each order has multiple items). `categories` and `promotions` are small reference tables.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
In just 4 questions, you understand what exists, the purpose of each table, and the scale of data—a process that would traditionally take 30+ minutes
</Info>

### Phase 2: Structure Analysis - How is Data Organized?

Now that you know what exists, understand how data is structured.

<Steps>
<Step title="Examine Key Tables">
Look at the structure of important tables:

```text Natural Language Query
Show me the structure of the users table
```

**AI Response**:
```text
The users table has the following columns:
- id (integer, primary key)
- email (varchar, unique)
- username (varchar)
- password_hash (varchar)
- first_name (varchar)
- last_name (varchar)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
- status (varchar) - values: active, inactive, suspended
- email_verified (boolean)
```

**Follow-up Query**:
```text
What's the structure of the orders table?
```

**What You Learn**: Column names, data types, and constraints reveal how entities are defined and what validation exists.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Primary Keys">
Understand how records are uniquely identified:

```text Natural Language Query
Show me the primary key columns for all tables
```

**AI Response**:
```
users: id
products: id
categories: id
orders: id
order_items: id
payments: id
reviews: id
shipping_addresses: id
inventory: product_id
wishlists: id
promotions: id
```

**What You Learn**: Most tables use simple integer IDs. `inventory` uses `product_id` as primary key, suggesting a one-to-one relationship with products.
</Step>

<Step title="Find Nullable Fields">
Discover what data is required vs. optional:

```text Natural Language Query
Which columns in the users table allow NULL values?
```

**AI Response**:
```text
Nullable columns in users table:
- first_name
- last_name
- phone_number
- date_of_birth
- profile_image

Non-nullable columns:
- id, email, username, password_hash, created_at, status
```

**What You Learn**: Email and username are required (non-nullable), but names are optional. This suggests users might sign up with minimal information.
</Step>

<Step title="Check for Unique Constraints">
Identify uniqueness requirements:

```text Natural Language Query
What columns have unique constraints?
```

**AI Response**:
```text
Unique constraints found:
- users.email
- users.username
- products.sku
- orders.order_number
```

**What You Learn**: Users can't duplicate emails or usernames. Products have unique SKUs. Orders have unique order numbers for customer reference.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 3: Data Sampling - What's Actually in There?

Structure tells you what can exist. Sampling shows what actually exists.

<Steps>
<Step title="Sample Core Tables">
Look at real data to understand patterns:

```text Natural Language Query
Show me 5 sample users
```

**AI Response**: Interactive table showing 5 user records

![SQL Query Results](/images/106-chat-sql-query-results.png)

**What You See**:
- User IDs are sequential integers starting from 1
- Emails follow normal patterns (name@domain.com)
- Created dates range from 2023 to present
- Status is mostly "active" with a few "inactive"
- Some users have NULL names

**Key Insight**: This is real customer data, not test data. Handle carefully.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Data Distributions">
Understand how data is spread:

```text Natural Language Query
Count users by status
```

**AI Response**:
```
active: 14,123
inactive: 987
suspended: 124
```

**Follow-up**:
```text
What's the distribution of products by category?
```

**AI Response**: Shows category breakdown with counts

**What You Learn**: Most users are active (healthy sign). Product distribution reveals which categories are most populated.
</Step>

<Step title="Examine Date Ranges">
Understand temporal scope:

```text Natural Language Query
What's the date range of orders in the database?
```

**AI Response**:
```text
Earliest order: 2022-03-15
Latest order: 2024-11-12
Total span: 2 years, 7 months
```

**Follow-up**:
```text
Show me order count by month for the last 6 months
```

**AI Response**: Monthly breakdown showing recent trends

![Aggregation Query](/images/109-chat-aggregation-query.png)

**What You Learn**: Database contains over 2 years of historical data. Recent months show growth pattern (or decline, depending on the trend).
</Step>

<Step title="Spot Check Data Quality">
Look for potential issues:

```text Natural Language Query
Show me users with missing email addresses
```

**AI Response**:
```text
0 rows returned
```

**More Quality Checks**:
```text
Find products with null or zero prices
Show me orders with no order items
Find any users created in the future
```

**What You Learn**: Email is always populated (good data quality). These targeted checks reveal if there are data integrity issues to be aware of.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Common Values">
Understand typical data patterns:

```text Natural Language Query
What are the most common user email domains?
```

**AI Response**:
```
gmail.com: 4,567
yahoo.com: 2,345
hotmail.com: 1,234
company.com: 987
outlook.com: 876
```

**Follow-up**:
```text
What are the most popular product categories?
```

**What You Learn**: User base is primarily consumer (Gmail/Yahoo). Product category popularity guides where to focus analysis.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The AI assistant generates appropriate aggregation queries automatically. Toggle to SQL view to see how grouping and counting work.
</Tip>

### Phase 4: Relationship Mapping - How Do Tables Connect?

Understanding relationships reveals how data flows through the system.

<Steps>
<Step title="Discover Foreign Keys">
Ask about relationships directly:

```text Natural Language Query
How is the orders table related to other tables?
```

**AI Response**:
```text
The orders table has the following relationships:
- orders.user_id → users.id (many-to-one)
- orders.shipping_address_id → shipping_addresses.id (many-to-one)
- orders → order_items (one-to-many)
- orders → payments (one-to-one)
```

**What You Learn**: Orders connect to users (who placed them), shipping addresses (where they go), order items (what's in them), and payments (how they're paid).
</Step>

<Step title="Trace Data Flow">
Follow a customer's journey through the system:

```text Natural Language Query
Show me a specific user's orders with their items
```

**AI Response**: Executes join query showing user → orders → order_items

```text Follow-Up
For user id 5, show their orders with shipping addresses
```

**AI Response**: Multi-table join with user, orders, and shipping_addresses

**What You Learn**: You can trace a complete customer journey from user record through orders to shipping and payment.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand Many-to-Many Relationships">
Identify junction tables:

```text Natural Language Query
How are products related to categories?
```

**AI Response**:
```text
products.category_id → categories.id (many-to-one)
Each product belongs to one category
```

**Follow-up**:
```text
Are there any many-to-many relationships?
```

**AI Response**:
```text
Yes, the wishlists table connects users to products:
- wishlists.user_id → users.id
- wishlists.product_id → products.id
Multiple users can wishlist the same product
Users can have multiple products in their wishlist
```

**What You Learn**: Products belong to single categories (simpler model). Wishlists enable many-to-many user-product relationships.
</Step>

<Step title="Map Complete Relationships">
Build a mental model of the entire system:

```text Natural Language Query
Describe all the relationships between users, orders, products, and payments
```

**AI Response**:
```text
Data Flow:
1. users (customer accounts)
   ↓
2. orders (purchase records)
   - References user_id
   - References shipping_address_id
   ↓
3. order_items (line items in each order)
   - References order_id
   - References product_id
   ↓
4. products (items for sale)
   - References category_id
   ↓
5. payments (financial transactions)
   - References order_id
```

**What You Learn**: The complete data flow from user through order to payment. This mental model guides all future queries.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Relationship Integrity">
Verify referential integrity:

```text Natural Language Query
Find any orders with no matching user
```

**AI Response**:
```text
0 rows returned
```

**More Integrity Checks**:
```text
Find order_items with no matching product
Show me payments with no corresponding order
```

**What You Learn**: Foreign key constraints are enforced (good database design). No orphaned records exist.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
At this point, you have a complete understanding of the database structure, relationships, and data quality—all without writing a single SQL query yourself
</Check>

### Phase 5: Quality Assessment - Is Data Clean?

Before relying on this data, assess its quality and completeness.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Completeness">
Identify missing or incomplete data:

```text Natural Language Query
What percentage of users have verified emails?
```

**AI Response**:
```
Verified: 12,456 (81.7%)
Not verified: 2,778 (18.3%)
```

**Follow-up Checks**:
```text
How many orders are missing shipping addresses?
What percentage of products have reviews?
How many users have never placed an order?
```

**What You Learn**: Email verification rate is good. You might find that some data is incomplete (e.g., 30% of users never ordered), which affects analysis.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Outliers">
Find unusual data that might indicate issues:

```text Natural Language Query
Show me products with unusually high or low prices
```

**AI Response**: Products priced at $0 or over $10,000

**More Outlier Checks**:
```text
Find orders with extremely high total amounts
Show me users created with future dates
Find products with negative inventory
```

**What You Learn**: A few products priced at $0 might be errors or special items. High-value orders could be bulk purchases or fraud.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Consistency">
Verify data makes logical sense:

```text Natural Language Query
Are there any orders where the total doesn't match the sum of order items?
```

**AI Response**: Executes calculation comparing order totals to sum of items

```text Follow-Up
Find users with orders but no shipping address on record
Show me payments that don't match their order totals
```

**What You Learn**: Data consistency issues that might indicate bugs in the application or data entry problems.
</Step>

<Step title="Assess Data Freshness">
Understand how current the data is:

```text Natural Language Query
When was the most recent order placed?
```

**AI Response**:
```text
Most recent order: 2024-11-12 14:35:22 (2 hours ago)
```

**Follow-up**:
```text
How many orders were placed today?
When were products last updated?
```

**What You Learn**: Data is current and actively updated. This is a live, operational database.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If you discover data quality issues during exploration, document them but avoid attempting fixes without proper authorization, especially on production databases
</Warning>

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Developer's First Day

**Context**: Sarah joins a team maintaining a legacy application. She needs to implement a new feature that displays a customer's order history.

**Traditional Approach**: Read outdated wiki documentation, ask busy teammates, study schema diagrams, write test queries.

**AI-Powered Approach**:

<Steps>
<Step title="Understand the Domain">
```text AI Conversation

## Best Practices for AI-Powered Exploration

### Start Broad, Then Narrow

<Steps>
<Step title="Begin with Inventory">
```text
What tables exist?
How many rows in each table?
```
Get the big picture first.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify Key Tables">
```text
Which tables are most important?
What are the core business entities?
```
Focus on what matters.
</Step>

<Step title="Deep Dive">
```text
Show me the structure of [specific table]
How is [table] related to [other table]?
```
Understand details only after you have context.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Use Follow-Up Questions

The AI remembers your conversation context:

```text Good Conversation Flow
You: Show me all users
AI: [Returns 15,000 users]

You: Just show 10
AI: [Limits to 10, remembers we're talking about users]

You: Only active ones
AI: [Filters to active, still knows it's the users table]

You: With their order counts
AI: [Adds join to orders with COUNT, maintains all previous context]
```

<Tip>
Each question builds on previous context. You don't need to repeat "users table" in every question
</Tip>

### Toggle to SQL View for Learning

Every AI response that returns data can show you the generated SQL:

![SQL Code View](/images/107-chat-sql-code-view.png)

**Why View SQL?**
- Learn SQL syntax naturally
- Verify the AI understood correctly
- Copy queries for documentation
- Adapt for your own code

### Save Useful Queries to Scratchpad

When you discover useful queries, preserve them:

![Move to Scratchpad](/images/113-chat-move-to-scratchpad-dialog.png)

**What to Save**:
- Queries that reveal important patterns
- Complex joins you'll need again
- Data quality checks worth repeating
- Exploratory queries that became important

### Ask About Data, Not Just Structure

Go beyond "what columns exist" to "what data exists":

```text Structure Questions (Good)
What's in the users table?
How are orders structured?

Data Questions (Better)
What are common user email domains?
What's the distribution of order statuses?
Are there any data quality issues?
```

Data questions reveal how the database is actually used.

### Verify AI Responses with Samples

When the AI makes a claim, verify it:

```text
AI: "Orders always have a payment record"

You: Show me orders without payments
[Verify the claim is true]
```

<Warning>
AI is usually correct, but always verify important assumptions with sample data
</Warning>

## Common Exploration Questions

Use these question templates for efficient exploration:

### Discovery Phase
```text
What tables are available?
How many rows are in each table?
What are the largest tables?
Which tables were most recently modified?
```

### Structure Phase
```text
What's the structure of the [table] table?
What columns are in [table]?
Which columns in [table] are required vs. optional?
What are the primary keys?
```

### Data Phase
```text
Show me 10 sample rows from [table]
What are the most common values in [column]?
What's the date range of data in [table]?
Count records by [category column]
```

### Relationship Phase
```text
How is [table1] related to [table2]?
What foreign keys exist in [table]?
Show me [entity] with its related [other entities]
Are there any many-to-many relationships?
```

### Quality Phase
```text
Find rows with missing [column] values
Show me duplicate records in [table]
Are there any orphaned records in [table]?
What percentage of [table] has [condition]?
Find any [entity] with invalid [attribute]
```

## Handling Errors During Exploration

![Error Message](/images/108-chat-error-message.png)

Even with AI, you might encounter errors:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Table Not Found">
**Error**: `relation "tablename" does not exist`

**Cause**: Typo in table name or table is in different schema

**Solution**:
```text
What tables are available?
[Verify correct table name and spelling]
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Query Timeout">
**Error**: `query execution timeout`

**Cause**: Query on very large table without limits

**Solution**:
```text
Show me just 100 rows from [large table]
Count rows in [table] where [recent date filter]
```
Always add limits and filters for large tables.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Denied">
**Error**: `permission denied for table`

**Cause**: Database user lacks SELECT permission

**Solution**: Contact database administrator for read access. In production, you should have read-only credentials.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ambiguous Question">
**Error**: AI returns unexpected results

**Cause**: Question could be interpreted multiple ways

**Solution**: Rephrase more specifically:
```text
Ambiguous: "Show me recent records"
Specific: "Show me users created in the last 7 days"
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
