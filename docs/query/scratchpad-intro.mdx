# Scratchpad Introduction

The Scratchpad is WhoDB's powerful SQL query editor that allows you to write, execute, and manage custom SQL queries. It combines a modern code editor with results visualization, query history, and multi-cell support for organizing complex workflows.

<Tip>
The Scratchpad is your SQL playground for exploring data, testing queries, and performing advanced operations
</Tip>

## Main Interface Overview

When you access the Scratchpad view for the first time, you'll see the complete query interface:

![Scratchpad Main View](/images/27-scratchpad-main-view.png)

The Scratchpad interface consists of several key components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Capabilities

### SQL Query Execution

Execute any SQL query supported by your database engine:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="SELECT Queries">
Retrieve data from your tables:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, created_at
FROM users
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

Results display in an interactive grid with sorting, filtering, and export capabilities.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Data Modification">
Insert, update, or delete data:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = price * 1.1
WHERE category = 'electronics'
AND price > 100;
```

Execution results show how many rows were affected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Aggregations">
Perform calculations and groupings:

```sql
SELECT
  category,
  COUNT(*) as total_items,
  AVG(price) as avg_price,
  MAX(price) as max_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_items DESC;
```

Perfect for analytics and reporting.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Joins">
Combine data from multiple tables:

```sql
SELECT
  u.id,
  u.username,
  COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
  SUM(o.total) as total_spent
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.username
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

Visualize complex relationships with ease.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Multi-Cell Organization

Organize related queries in separate cells within the same Scratchpad:

![Scratchpad Multiple Cells](/images/31-scratchpad-multiple-pages.png)

Each cell operates independently, allowing you to:
- Run multiple queries without losing previous results
- Organize queries by task or workflow
- Compare results between different queries
- Reorder cells to match your workflow

<Info>
Each cell maintains its own execution history and results
</Info>

### Query History

All executed queries are automatically saved to history:

![Query History Panel](/images/33-scratchpad-query-history.png)

Quick access to:
- Recently executed queries
- Query cloning for quick variations
- Search through historical queries
- Timestamp and execution details

### Real-Time Feedback

Get instant feedback on query execution:

**Successful Execution:**

![Query Results](/images/29-scratchpad-query-results.png)

See row counts, execution time, and formatted results.

**Error Handling:**

![Query Error](/images/30-scratchpad-query-error.png)

Clear error messages help you debug SQL syntax issues.

</Card>
<Card title="More Databases" icon="plus">

</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Data Exploration

Quickly explore your database structure and data:

```sql
-- Check table size
SELECT COUNT(*) as row_count FROM users;

-- View sample data
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;

-- Check column data types and constraints
PRAGMA table_info(users);  -- SQLite
DESC users;                -- MySQL
```

### 2. Performance Testing

Test query performance before deploying to production:

```sql
-- Find slow-running queries
SELECT
  id,
  username,
  email
FROM users
WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1000;
```

### 3. Data Validation

Verify data quality and integrity:

```sql
-- Find missing or invalid data
SELECT id, name, email
FROM users
WHERE email IS NULL
  OR email NOT LIKE '%@%.%';

-- Check for duplicates
SELECT email, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 4. Batch Operations

Perform bulk data modifications:

```sql
-- Archive old records
DELETE FROM audit_logs
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Update multiple records
UPDATE users
SET verified = true
WHERE email LIKE '%@company.com';
```

## Interface Elements

### Execution Controls

At the top of each cell, you'll find:

![Scratchpad Code Editor](/images/28-scratchpad-code-editor.png)

- **Run Button** (`Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`): Execute the query
- **Clear Button**: Remove results and start fresh
- **Cell Menu**: Additional cell options and settings
- **Status Indicator**: Shows query execution status

### Action Results

After executing action queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):

![Action Result](/images/40-scratchpad-action-result.png)

WhoDB displays:
- Number of rows affected

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Master these shortcuts for faster query work:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Execute query |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F` | Format code |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + N` | New cell |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + D` | Duplicate cell |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + /` | Toggle comment |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` | Undo |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Redo |

## Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Write Readable SQL">
Use consistent indentation and clear naming. Your future self will thank you.

```sql
SELECT
  u.id,
  u.username,
  COUNT(o.id) as total_orders
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.status = 'active'
GROUP BY u.id, u.username
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```
</Step>
<Step title="Use Meaningful Comments">
Document complex logic or important context within your SQL.

```sql
-- Find users who placed orders in the last 90 days
-- but haven't made a purchase in the last 30 days
SELECT u.id, u.username
FROM users u
WHERE u.id IN (
  SELECT user_id FROM orders
  WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
)
AND u.id NOT IN (
  SELECT user_id FROM orders
  WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
);
```
</Step>
<Step title="Test Safely">
Always use LIMIT when exploring large tables or use transactions for modifications.

```sql
-- Safe exploration
SELECT * FROM large_table LIMIT 100;

-- Safe modification (if your database supports transactions)
BEGIN;
UPDATE users SET active = false WHERE inactive_days > 365;
-- Review the change, then COMMIT or ROLLBACK
```
</Step>
<Step title="Leverage Query History">
Clone and modify previous queries instead of rewriting from scratch.
</Step>
</Steps>
