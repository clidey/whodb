## Phase 1: Data Exploration

Before writing complex queries, understand what data you're working with.

### Interactive Table Exploration

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Your Table">
Select the table containing your analysis data.

![Data View](/images/09-data-view-users-table.png)

The data grid displays your records in a familiar spreadsheet format, making it easy to scan and understand the data structure.
</Step>

<Step title="Examine Column Types and Values">
Review each column:
- **Data types**: Are dates formatted correctly? Are numbers in the expected range?
- **Value distributions**: What values appear most frequently? Are there nulls?
- **Data quality**: Do you see obvious errors or anomalies?

This preliminary scan informs your analysis approach.
</Step>

<Step title="Apply Initial Filters">
Start with simple filtering to narrow your focus:

![Filter UI](/images/16-data-view-where-conditions-popover.png)

Example filters:
- `status = 'active'` to focus on current records
- `created_at >= '2024-01-01'` to focus on recent periods
- `amount > 0` to exclude zero-value records
- `is_deleted = false` to remove archived data

Basic filters help you understand your dataset's composition.
</Step>

<Step title="Search for Specific Patterns">
Use search to locate specific values across columns:

![Search Highlight](/images/19-data-view-search-highlight.png)

Search is useful for:
- Finding specific user accounts or transactions
- Locating error messages or anomalous data
- Verifying whether specific data exists
- Quick spot-checks during analysis
</Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Relationships

Navigate to related tables to understand your data model:

<Steps>
<Step title="Explore Foreign Keys">
Identify which columns link to other tables. This tells you:
- What related data is available
- How to write effective joins
- What aggregations make sense

Example: An `orders` table with a `user_id` foreign key tells you that order data can be linked to user data.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Table Dependencies">
Understanding relationships helps you:
- Write joins efficiently
- Validate aggregation logic
- Identify data consistency issues

Example: If a customer table has 5,000 records but orders table shows 6,000 unique customer IDs, you have orphaned orders.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Phase 2: Complex Analysis Queries

Once you understand your data, write sophisticated queries to extract insights.

### Opening the Query Interface

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Scratchpad">
Open the Scratchpad view for full SQL development capabilities:

![Scratchpad Code Editor](/images/28-scratchpad-code-editor.png)

The Scratchpad provides:
- Full SQL syntax highlighting
- Query history and saved queries
- Result pagination and sorting
- Multiple query cells for iterative analysis
</Step>

<Step title="Write Your First Query">
Start simple and build complexity:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users,
  AVG(amount) as average_amount
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01';
```

This baseline query tells you the scale and scope of your dataset.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Essential Analytics Queries

#### Aggregation & Summarization

Group data to find patterns and trends:

```sql
-- Sales by product category (most common analytics pattern)
SELECT
  category,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
  SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
  AVG(amount) as avg_transaction_size,
  MAX(amount) as max_transaction,
  MIN(amount) as min_transaction,
  STDDEV(amount) as revenue_volatility
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'
  AND status = 'completed'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

<Tip>
GROUP BY queries are the foundation of analytics. Use them constantly to break data into meaningful segments.
</Tip>

#### Time Series Analysis

Track metrics over time to identify trends:

```sql
-- Monthly revenue trend with growth rate
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)::date as month,
    SUM(amount) as revenue,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count
  FROM orders
  WHERE status = 'completed'
    AND created_at >= '2023-01-01'
  GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)
)
SELECT
  month,
  revenue,
  transaction_count,
  LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) as previous_month_revenue,
  ROUND(((revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month)) /
         LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100)::numeric, 2) as growth_percent
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

This reveals whether your metrics are growing, stable, or declining.

#### Cohort Analysis

Track how different user groups behave over time:

```sql
-- User retention by signup cohort
WITH user_cohorts AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)::date as signup_month
  FROM users
),
user_activity AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', activity_date)::date as activity_month
  FROM user_events
  WHERE event_type = 'purchase'
)
SELECT
  c.signup_month,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(a.activity_month, c.signup_month)) * 12 +
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM AGE(a.activity_month, c.signup_month)) as months_since_signup,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id) as active_users
FROM user_cohorts c
LEFT JOIN user_activity a ON c.user_id = a.user_id
GROUP BY c.signup_month, months_since_signup
ORDER BY c.signup_month DESC, months_since_signup;
```

This shows which signup cohorts have the best retention and engagement.

#### Join-Based Analysis

Combine data from multiple tables:

```sql
-- Customer lifetime value analysis
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.customer_name,
  c.segment,
  COUNT(o.order_id) as lifetime_orders,
  SUM(o.amount) as lifetime_value,
  AVG(o.amount) as avg_order_value,
  MAX(o.created_at) as last_purchase_date,
  MIN(o.created_at) as first_purchase_date,
  DATEDIFF(MAX(o.created_at), MIN(o.created_at)) as customer_tenure_days
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.segment
ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC;
```

This powerful pattern combines customer attributes with their transaction history.

#### Window Functions for Context

Calculate metrics while preserving row-level detail:

```sql
-- Orders ranked by amount, with percentile context
SELECT
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  amount,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) as rank,
  PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY amount) * 100 as percentile,
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as running_total
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

Window functions let you see individual records alongside aggregate context.

#### Anomaly Detection

Find unusual values that deviate from normal patterns:

```sql
-- Detect transactions that are statistical outliers
WITH transaction_stats AS (
  SELECT
    AVG(amount) as avg_amount,
    STDDEV(amount) as std_dev
  FROM orders
  WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
)
SELECT
  o.order_id,
  o.customer_id,
  o.amount,
  ts.avg_amount,
  ROUND((o.amount - ts.avg_amount) / ts.std_dev, 2) as std_deviations_from_mean,
  CASE
    WHEN ABS(o.amount - ts.avg_amount) > (3 * ts.std_dev) THEN 'ANOMALY'
    WHEN ABS(o.amount - ts.avg_amount) > (2 * ts.std_dev) THEN 'UNUSUAL'
    ELSE 'NORMAL'
  END as classification
FROM orders o, transaction_stats ts
WHERE ABS(o.amount - ts.avg_amount) > (2 * ts.std_dev)
ORDER BY ABS(o.amount - ts.avg_amount) DESC;
```

This finds outliers that might indicate fraud, data errors, or significant business events.

### Query Execution & Results

<Steps>
<Step title="Execute Your Query">
Click the Execute button or press Ctrl+Enter:

![Query Results](/images/86-scratchpad-select-query-result.png)

The query runs and results appear below your query text.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Results">
Examine the result set:
- **Row count**: Does the number of rows make sense?
- **Value ranges**: Are values within expected ranges?
- **Null values**: Are nulls appearing where expected?
- **Data types**: Do columns display correct types?
</Step>

<Step title="Sort Results">
Click column headers to sort:

```
Sales by Category (sorted descending by revenue):
Electronics | 5,400 | $850,000
Furniture   | 3,200 | $620,000
Clothing    | 8,100 | $580,000
```

Sorting helps identify top performers and outliers.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Multi-Cell Queries

For complex analysis, break your work into multiple cells:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Intermediate Queries">
Build analysis step-by-step:

![Multiple Cells](/images/48-scratchpad-multiple-cells-results.png)

**Cell 1**: Clean and filter raw data
```sql
-- Get valid orders from the past year
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND created_at >= '2023-01-01'
  AND amount > 0;
```

**Cell 2**: Aggregate into meaningful metrics
```sql
-- Calculate metrics by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count, SUM(amount) as revenue
FROM valid_orders_cte
GROUP BY category;
```

**Cell 3**: Format for presentation
```sql
-- Add rankings and percentages
SELECT *,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) as rank,
  ROUND(revenue / SUM(revenue) OVER () * 100, 1) as revenue_percent
FROM category_metrics;
```

This step-by-step approach is easier to debug and modify.
</Step>

<Step title="Use Query History">
Access previous queries instantly:

![Query History](/images/33-scratchpad-query-history.png)

Your query history lets you:
- Find previously successful queries
- Clone and modify queries
- Track your analysis progression
- Recreate analysis later
</Step>
</Steps>

## Phase 3: Data Validation

Before sharing analysis results, validate your queries.

### Validation Checklist

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Row Count Validation">
After any major operation, verify row counts make sense:
- Total rows: Does COUNT(*) match expectations?
- Filtered rows: Did your WHERE clause exclude as expected?
- Grouped rows: Is GROUP BY producing the right number of groups?

Suspicious row counts often indicate logic errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Value Range Validation">
Check that values fall within expected ranges:
- Amounts: Are they positive? Below maximum limits?
- Dates: Are they between expected periods? Any future dates?
- Percentages: Do they sum to 100% or 1.0 as expected?
- IDs: Are they sequential or as expected?

Out-of-range values often indicate data quality issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="NULL Handling Validation">
Verify NULL behavior:
- COUNT(column) vs COUNT(*): Do they match? If not, you have NULLs.
- COALESCE usage: Are you handling NULLs appropriately?
- JOIN logic: Did LEFT JINs produce NULLs as expected?

NULLs are a common source of analysis mistakes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Join Validation">
Verify join results are correct:
- Compare JOIN results: Does INNER JOIN produce fewer rows than LEFT JOIN? (It should)
- Check for duplicates: Did your join multiply rows unexpectedly?
- Verify keys: Do the join keys match your expectations?

Incorrect joins are a frequent source of errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Aggregate Validation">
Cross-check aggregates:
- SUM vs COUNT with SUM: Do they align?
- Manual spot-checks: Pick a few groups and verify calculations manually
- Compare methods: Calculate the same metric different ways and verify results match
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Temporal Validation">
For time-based analysis, verify dates:
- Timezone handling: Are dates correct for your timezone?
- Date ranges: Do you include the expected periods?
- Seasonality: Do seasonal patterns make business sense?
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Phase 4: Exporting & Sharing

Once validated, export your analysis results.

### Export Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Your Data">
Choose what to export:

![Export Dialog](/images/20-data-view-export-dialog.png)

Options:
- **All**: Every row in your result set
- **Selected**: Only rows you've highlighted
- **Filtered**: Rows matching your current filters
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Your Format">
Select the format that matches your audience and downstream use:

![Export Format](/images/21-data-view-export-format-dropdown.png)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="CSV">
Best for:
- Excel or Google Sheets analysis
- Data science workflows (Python, R, pandas)
- Generic data exchange between systems
- Sharing with non-technical stakeholders

CSV is universal and widely supported.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Excel">
Best for:
- Business stakeholders and executives
- Complex spreadsheet formatting
- Pivot tables and charts
- When you want to include formulas or formatting

More polished than CSV for business contexts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="JSON">
Best for:
- NoSQL workflows
- JavaScript/web application integration
- Preserving nested data structures
- API-based data workflows
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SQL">
Best for:
- Database backups and restore
- Sharing with other databases
- Version control of specific datasets
- Reproducibility and documentation

SQL INSERT statements are human-readable and executable.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Export Options">
Customize the export:

**For CSV:**
- **Delimiter**: Comma (standard), semicolon (European), pipe (data with commas), tab
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 (universal), ISO-8859-1 (legacy)

**Column Selection:**
- Include/exclude specific columns
- Reorder columns to match report structure
- Exclude sensitive data like passwords or API keys
</Step>

<Step title="Download and Verify">
Download your file and do a quick sanity check:
- Row count matches query results
- Column order is correct
- Data formatting is readable
- No encoding issues with special characters
</Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Analytics Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customer Segmentation

Identify different customer groups for targeted marketing:

```sql
-- Segment customers by behavior
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.customer_name,
  c.segment_category,
  COUNT(o.order_id) as lifetime_orders,
  SUM(o.amount) as lifetime_value,
  MAX(o.created_at) as last_purchase,
  DATEDIFF(NOW(), MAX(o.created_at)) as days_since_purchase,
  CASE
    WHEN SUM(o.amount) > 5000 AND DATEDIFF(NOW(), MAX(o.created_at)) < 30 THEN 'High Value Active'
    WHEN SUM(o.amount) > 5000 AND DATEDIFF(NOW(), MAX(o.created_at)) < 90 THEN 'High Value At Risk'
    WHEN SUM(o.amount) > 1000 AND DATEDIFF(NOW(), MAX(o.created_at)) < 30 THEN 'Medium Value Active'
    WHEN SUM(o.amount) <= 1000 AND COUNT(o.order_id) >= 5 THEN 'Small Value Loyal'
    WHEN COUNT(o.order_id) = 1 THEN 'One-Time Buyer'
    ELSE 'Dormant'
  END as customer_segment
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.segment_category
ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC;
```

Export this for marketing teams to enable targeted campaigns.

### Scenario 2: Churn Prediction

Identify customers at risk of leaving:

```sql
-- Find customers showing churn signals
WITH customer_activity AS (
  SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    MAX(o.created_at) as last_order_date,
    DATEDIFF(NOW(), MAX(o.created_at)) as days_inactive,
    AVG(o.amount) as avg_order_value,
    STDDEV(o.amount) as order_volatility
  FROM customers c
  LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
)
SELECT
  *,
  CASE
    WHEN days_inactive > 180 AND total_orders < 5 THEN 'HIGH RISK'
    WHEN days_inactive > 90 AND total_orders < 10 THEN 'MEDIUM RISK'
    WHEN days_inactive > 60 THEN 'LOW RISK'
    ELSE 'STABLE'
  END as churn_risk
FROM customer_activity
WHERE days_inactive > 60
ORDER BY days_inactive DESC;
```

### Scenario 3: Product Performance Analysis

Identify your best and worst performing products:

```sql
-- Detailed product performance metrics
SELECT
  p.product_id,
  p.product_name,
  p.category,
  COUNT(DISTINCT oi.order_id) as times_sold,
  SUM(oi.quantity) as total_units_sold,
  SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) as total_revenue,
  AVG(oi.price) as avg_price,
  MIN(oi.price) as min_price,
  MAX(oi.price) as max_price,
  ROUND(SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT oi.order_id), 0), 2) as revenue_per_sale,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY p.category ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) DESC) as rank_in_category
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, p.category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## Performance Optimization for Large Datasets

### Query Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Index Usage">
Use indexes on heavily-filtered columns:
```sql
-- Check if your query uses indexes (PostgreSQL)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
```

If the plan shows "Seq Scan" on large tables, the column should be indexed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reduce Scope">
Always filter to smaller date ranges:
```sql
-- SLOW: No date filter
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE status = 'pending';

-- FAST: Date filtered
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE status = 'pending'
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Simplify Joins">
Unnecessary joins slow queries significantly:
```sql
-- Only join tables you actually need
SELECT o.*, c.customer_name
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
-- Don't add: JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
-- if you don't use oi columns
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use CTEs for Clarity">
Complex queries are easier to debug as multiple steps:
```sql
WITH step1 AS (
  SELECT * FROM raw_data WHERE filter
),
step2 AS (
  SELECT * FROM step1 WHERE another_filter
)
SELECT * FROM step2;
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Troubleshooting Query Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Query Runs Too Slowly">
- Add time range filters to reduce rows
- Check indexes with EXPLAIN
- Simplify joins or split into multiple queries
- Pre-aggregate data in intermediate steps
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Results Don't Match Expectations">
- Check NULL handling in aggregates
- Verify JOIN logic (INNER vs LEFT JOIN)
- Validate WHERE conditions
- Check for timezone issues with dates
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rows Multiplied by Join">
This happens with many-to-many joins:
```sql
-- PROBLEM: Orders have multiple items, customer table is duplicate
SELECT c.*, o.*, oi.*
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id;
-- Result: 3 order items means customer row appears 3 times

-- SOLUTION: Aggregate first
SELECT c.*, SUM(oi.price * oi.quantity) as order_total
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY c.id;
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
