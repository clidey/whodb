## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended for Teams)

Docker is the simplest way to deploy WhoDB for your team. Everyone connects to a single instance that handles all databases.

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Server with at least 2GB RAM
- Network access from your team

**Step 1: Create docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  whodb:
    image: clidey/whodb:latest
    container_name: whodb
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      # Optional: Configure default database
      DB_HOST: ${DB_HOST:-localhost}
      DB_PORT: ${DB_PORT:-5432}
      DB_USER: ${DB_USER}
      DB_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
      DB_NAME: ${DB_NAME}
    volumes:
      # Optional: Persist query history
      - whodb_data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - whodb_network

  # Optional: PostgreSQL for testing
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    container_name: postgres_demo
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: demo_password
      POSTGRES_DB: demo_db
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - whodb_network
    # Only expose if needed for local testing
    # ports:
    #   - "5432:5432"

volumes:
  whodb_data:
  postgres_data:

networks:
  whodb_network:
    driver: bridge
```

**Step 2: Deploy**

```bash
# Copy the above YAML to docker-compose.yml
# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify it's running
docker-compose logs -f whodb

# Check status
docker ps | grep whodb
```

**Step 3: Access WhoDB**

Navigate to `http://your_server:3000` in your browser. WhoDB is now accessible to your team.

<Tip>
Use `http://localhost:3000` for local testing, or replace with your server's IP/hostname for team access.
</Tip>

### Option 2: Kubernetes Deployment (Enterprise)

For large teams with Kubernetes infrastructure:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: whodb
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: whodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: whodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: whodb
        image: clidey/whodb:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "1Gi"
            cpu: "500m"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 3000
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: whodb-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: whodb
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Deploy with:
```bash
kubectl apply -f whodb-deployment.yaml
```

### Option 3: Traditional Server Deployment

For teams without Docker or Kubernetes:

**Download and Install:**
```bash
# Download the latest WhoDB binary
wget https://github.com/clidey/whodb/releases/latest/download/whodb-server

chmod +x whodb-server

# Run as background service
./whodb-server &

# Or use systemd
sudo systemctl start whodb
```

## Securing Your Team Instance

### Enable HTTPS/SSL

<Warning>
Never expose WhoDB over HTTP in production. Always use HTTPS/SSL encryption.
</Warning>

**With Docker and Nginx Reverse Proxy:**

```bash
# Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
sudo apt-get install certbot nginx

# Get certificate (replace yourdomain.com with your domain)
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com

# Configure Nginx as reverse proxy
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/whodb
```

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

Enable and restart:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/whodb /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Network Security

<Steps>
<Step title="Use Firewall Rules">
Only allow trusted IPs to access WhoDB:
```bash
# UFW example (Ubuntu)
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp (redirects to 443)
sudo ufw enable

# Restrict to specific IPs if possible
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.0/24 to any port 443
```
</Step>
<Step title="Require VPN for Access">
If possible, require team members to connect via VPN before accessing WhoDB. This adds an extra security layer.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Audit Logging">
Configure WhoDB to log all connections and queries for security auditing.
</Step>
<Step title="Rotate Credentials Regularly">
Change database credentials monthly or after team member departures.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Database Connections for Your Team

### Creating Shared Connection Profiles

Instead of giving team members raw credentials, create connection profiles:

<Steps>
<Step title="Define Connection Standards">
Create a document with all connection details your team needs:
- Development database
- Staging database
- Production database (if applicable)
- Data warehouse
- Analytics database

Example:
```
Development PostgreSQL
  Host: dev-db.internal
  Port: 5432
  Database: myapp_dev
  Username: dev_user (read-write)

Production PostgreSQL
  Host: prod-db.internal
  Port: 5432
  Database: myapp_prod
  Username: prod_readonly (read-only)
```
</Step>
<Step title="Generate Read-Only Users">
For each database, create dedicated read-only users:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Create read-only user
CREATE USER whodb_readonly WITH PASSWORD 'secure_random_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE myapp_dev TO whodb_readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO whodb_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO whodb_readonly;

-- Apply to future tables
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO whodb_readonly;
```

```sql
-- MySQL: Create read-only user
CREATE USER 'whodb_readonly'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_random_password';
GRANT SELECT ON myapp_dev.* TO 'whodb_readonly'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
</Step>
<Step title="Document Connection String">
Create a reference document for your team:
```
Development Connection (Read-Only)
Host: dev-db.internal
Port: 5432
Username: whodb_readonly
Password: [Store in your password manager]
Database: myapp_dev
```
</Step>
<Step title="Share via Secure Channel">
Distribute credentials via your password manager, not email or Slack.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Multiple Database Access Levels

**Production Environment:**

```
Level 1: Analysts (Read-Only)
- Can view all data
- Cannot modify or delete
- Cannot access sensitive tables

Level 2: Developers (Read-Write)
- Can view and edit data
- Can run queries
- Cannot drop tables

Level 3: DBAs (Admin)
- Full access
- Can modify schema
- Can backup/restore
```

**Implementation:**

```sql
-- PostgreSQL example: Create three access levels

-- Level 1: Read-only
CREATE USER analyst_user WITH PASSWORD 'analyst_pass';
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO analyst_user;

-- Level 2: Read-write
CREATE USER developer_user WITH PASSWORD 'dev_pass';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO developer_user;

-- Level 3: Admin (superuser or high privileges)
CREATE USER dba_user WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'dba_pass';
```

- Production (Read-Only): connection details
- Staging (Read-Write): connection details
- Development (Full Access): connection details

## Common Queries
- Daily active users: [query]
- Recent errors: [query]
- Revenue trends: [query]

## Security
- Never share credentials
- Always use connection profiles
- Log out when done
- Report suspicious activity
```

### Access Control Rules

<Warning>
Establish clear policies to prevent data breaches:
1. Never store production credentials in version control
2. Use strong, unique passwords for each database user

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Backups

Ensure your team's work isn't lost:

```bash
# Daily backup script (cron job)
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="/backups/whodb"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Backup all databases
for db in $DATABASES; do
  pg_dump -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST $db > $BACKUP_DIR/$db\_$DATE.sql
done

# Keep only last 30 days
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "*.sql" -mtime +30 -delete
```

Set up in crontab:
```bash
# Run backup daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup-databases.sh
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor WhoDB instance health:

```bash
# Check system resources
docker stats whodb

# Check error logs
docker logs whodb | grep -i error

# Monitor database connections
# In WhoDB Scratchpad:
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

### Upgrading WhoDB

Keep your instance updated:

```bash
# Pull latest image
docker pull clidey/whodb:latest

# Stop current instance
docker-compose down

# Update compose file (latest tag)
docker-compose up -d

# Verify it's running
docker ps | grep whodb
```

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Team Member Can't Connect to Database">
**Diagnosis:**
1. Verify user exists in database
2. Check password is correct
3. Confirm host/port are correct
4. Verify firewall allows connection

**Solution:**
1. Double-check credentials
2. Test connection from command line first
3. Check database server logs
4. Verify user has CONNECT privilege
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Query Performance is Slow for Team">
**Symptoms:** Team members report slow data loading

**Solutions:**
1. Check database server load: `top`, `htop`
2. Analyze slow queries: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
3. Verify indexes exist on frequently queried columns
4. Add connection pooling
5. Consider database optimization or scaling
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Team Member Can't See All Tables">
**Diagnosis:**
1. User account doesn't have VIEW permission on schema
2. Tables are in different schema they can't access

**Solution:**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Grant schema access
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO username;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO username;
```

```sql
-- MySQL: Grant database access
GRANT SELECT ON myapp.* TO 'username'@'%';
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Need to Restore from Backup">
**Process:**
1. Locate backup file
2. Restore using database tools:

```bash
# PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres -d myapp_prod < backup_20240115.sql

# MySQL
mysql -u root -p myapp_prod < backup_20240115.sql
```

3. Verify data integrity
4. Notify team of restoration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security Concern: Unauthorized Query Detected">
**Immediate Actions:**
1. Review query history: which user ran it, what did it access
2. Check recent connections: who accessed production
3. Disable suspicious user account
4. Rotate production database credentials
5. Audit all recent queries
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced: Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

For larger teams, integrate with your identity provider:

<Note>
SSO integration is a future feature. For now, use strong, managed passwords with your team's password manager.
</Note>

**Coming Soon:** WhoDB will support:
- LDAP/Active Directory
- OAuth2 (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- SAML for enterprise
- API key authentication
