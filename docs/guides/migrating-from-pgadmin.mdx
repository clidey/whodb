# Migrating from pgAdmin to WhoDB

pgAdmin is the industry standard for PostgreSQL management, and for good reason. But WhoDB takes the best ideas from pgAdmin and reimagines them for modern workflows. This guide will help you transition smoothly and discover why so many PostgreSQL developers are switching.

<Info>
WhoDB supports PostgreSQL as a first-class citizen while also supporting MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and Redis. Plus, it's significantly faster and more intuitive than pgAdmin.
</Info>

## Why Switch from pgAdmin to WhoDB?

pgAdmin is powerful but complex. WhoDB provides the features you need with half the complexity:

## Interface Differences Explained

### pgAdmin's Tree Navigation vs WhoDB's Sidebar

**pgAdmin** uses a deep tree structure:
```
Servers
  └─ My Server
     └─ Databases
        └─ postgres
           └─ Schemas
              └─ public
                 └─ Tables
                    └─ users
```

**WhoDB** uses a flat, expandable sidebar:
```
Database: postgres
  Schemas
    └─ public
       └─ users (click to view data)
```

The WhoDB approach is faster and less disorienting.

### Modal Dialogs vs Single-Purpose Views

**pgAdmin** opens complex property dialogs with many tabs for every action (creating tables, editing columns, etc.).

**WhoDB** has dedicated views for each task:
- **Data View** for browsing/editing records
- **Explore View** for schema structure
- **Graph View** for relationships
- **Scratchpad View** for queries

Each view is focused and lightweight.

## Keyboard Shortcuts: pgAdmin Habits in WhoDB

### Shortcuts That Transferred

| Action | pgAdmin | WhoDB |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Execute Query | F5 or Cmd/Ctrl+Enter | Cmd/Ctrl+Enter |
| Copy | Cmd/Ctrl+C | Cmd/Ctrl+C |
| Paste | Cmd/Ctrl+V | Cmd/Ctrl+V |
| Find | Cmd/Ctrl+F | Cmd/Ctrl+F |
| Select All | Cmd/Ctrl+A | Cmd/Ctrl+A |

### New Shortcuts to Learn

![Explore Users Table](/images/07-explore-users-table.png)

## Common pgAdmin Tasks in WhoDB

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Creating a New Table">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Open Scratchpad view
2. Write CREATE TABLE statement:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
3. Execute query
4. Table appears in sidebar

**Note**: Visual table creation UI is coming in a future update. For now, SQL is the most reliable method.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Adding a Column to Existing Table">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Go to Scratchpad
2. Write ALTER TABLE statement:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);
```
3. Execute
4. Refresh Explore view to see new column

Alternatively, use Explore view's "Add Column" button (if available).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Viewing Indexes">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Click table name
2. Click "Explore" view tab
3. Scroll to "Indexes" section
4. See all indexes with their columns

Much simpler than pgAdmin's property tabs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Analyzing Query Performance">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Open Scratchpad
2. Add EXPLAIN ANALYZE before your query:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT users.id, COUNT(posts.id)
FROM users
LEFT JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.user_id
GROUP BY users.id;
```
3. Execute to see query plan
4. Results show execution time and node costs

WhoDB displays the same information as pgAdmin but in a cleaner format.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Backing Up Your Database">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Select all rows from a table (Cmd/Ctrl+A)
2. Click "Export"
3. Choose "SQL" format
4. Click "Export" to download SQL INSERT statements

For full database backups, use pg_dump from command line:
```bash
pg_dump -U username -h hostname database_name > backup.sql
```

WhoDB's export is perfect for table-level backups but can't replace pg_dump for full database administration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Viewing Table Size">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Open Scratchpad
2. Run query:
```sql
SELECT
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```
3. See table sizes in results

pgAdmin has a built-in tool, but WhoDB's query approach is more flexible and transparent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Checking Active Connections">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Open Scratchpad
2. Run query:
```sql
SELECT pid, usename, application_name, state, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle';
```
3. View active queries and connections

WhoDB makes you write the query, which actually teaches you more about PostgreSQL internals.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Setting User Permissions">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Open Scratchpad
2. Write GRANT statement:
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON public.users TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_user;
```
3. Execute to apply permissions

For complex permission management, you might still use pgAdmin, but WhoDB works perfectly for this.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What's Different (and Why It's Better)

### No Plugin Dependencies

pgAdmin's ER diagram requires Graphviz. WhoDB's graph visualization is built-in and interactive.

**pgAdmin Workflow:**
1. Install Graphviz (complex on some systems)
2. Configure pgAdmin to find Graphviz
3. Generate ER diagram (static image)

**WhoDB Workflow:**
1. Click "Graph" tab
2. Interactive visualization loads instantly
3. Click nodes to explore

### Faster Data Exploration

pgAdmin's nested menus create unnecessary clicking. WhoDB's sidebar puts everything at your fingertips:

| Task | pgAdmin Clicks | WhoDB Clicks |
|------|---------------|------------|
| View table data | 4+ | 1 |
| Filter records | 3 | 2 |
| See table structure | 3 | 2 |
| Run query | 2 | 1 |

### Multi-Tab Connection Management

Both support multiple connections, but WhoDB's approach is simpler:

**pgAdmin**: Manage multiple server registrations with properties and folders
**WhoDB**: Open new browser tabs with different connections

### Better for Multi-Database Workflows

If you use PostgreSQL AND MySQL or SQLite:

**pgAdmin**: Limited to PostgreSQL only (or community versions for others)
**WhoDB**: Manage all databases from one interface

## Advanced Features You'll Appreciate

These capabilities go beyond what pgAdmin offers:

</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Transition Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Where's the Properties Dialog I'm Used To?">
**Solution**: Click the table → "Explore" view. All properties are displayed in organized sections without overwhelming dialogs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How Do I See Permissions for Users?">
**Solution**: Use Scratchpad to query pg_catalog tables:
```sql
SELECT usename, usesuper, usecreatedb, usecanlogin
FROM pg_user;
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I Schedule Maintenance Tasks?">
**Solution**: WhoDB doesn't have a scheduler like pgAdmin. Use pgAdmin or cron jobs for VACUUM, ANALYZE, and backups. WhoDB is best for interactive queries.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Sidebar Feels Overwhelming with Many Tables">
**Solution**: Use Cmd/Ctrl+K for quick navigation. Search for table names instead of scrolling.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I Need to Debug a Slow Query">
**Solution**: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE in Scratchpad:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT ...;
```
Results show the same execution plan as pgAdmin's EXPLAIN tool.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Still Use pgAdmin

WhoDB is excellent for 95% of PostgreSQL management, but pgAdmin is still better for:

- Complex backup and restore operations
- Database server administration (not just data)
- Automated maintenance scheduling
- Advanced permission management UI
- Managing multiple servers across enterprises

For daily data exploration, testing, and queries? WhoDB is superior.
