## Workflow Mapping: Your Familiar Tasks in WhoDB

### Task: Viewing Table Data

**In phpMyAdmin:**
1. Click database in left sidebar
2. Click table name
3. Click "Browse" tab
4. Data appears in table

**In WhoDB:**
1. Database visible in sidebar
2. Click table name directly
3. Data view appears immediately
4. No extra tabs needed

<Tip>
WhoDB's sidebar automatically shows your database structure. Just click any table to view its data instantly. No need for separate "browse" steps.
</Tip>

### Task: Editing a Row

**In phpMyAdmin:**
1. Click the pencil icon on a row
2. Wait for edit page to load
3. Modify values in form
4. Click "Go" to save

**In WhoDB:**
1. Right-click row → "Edit Row" (or double-click)
2. Modal opens with form

2. Select field → operator → value
3. Filter applies instantly

![Where Conditions Popover](/images/16-data-view-where-conditions-popover.png)

<Tip>
WhoDB's visual filter builder is much faster than phpMyAdmin's SQL-based approach, especially for non-developers.
</Tip>

### Task: Exporting Data

**In phpMyAdmin:**
1. Click "Export" tab
2. Select format (CSV, Excel, SQL)
3. Configure options through multiple pages
4. Click "Go"

**In WhoDB:**

4. Results appear below

**In WhoDB:**
1. Go to "Scratchpad" view
2. Type your query
3. Click "Run" or Cmd/Ctrl+Enter
4. Results appear below

**Advantage in WhoDB**: Multiple cells allow you to organize related queries and run them independently.

## Keyboard Shortcuts: Your Quick Reference

### Shortcuts You Already Know

| Action | phpMyAdmin | WhoDB |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Copy | Cmd/Ctrl+C | Cmd/Ctrl+C |
| Paste | Cmd/Ctrl+V | Cmd/Ctrl+V |
| Find | Cmd/Ctrl+F | Cmd/Ctrl+F |

| Quick Navigation | Cmd/Ctrl+K |

<Info>
WhoDB's shortcuts are designed for developers who already use modern code editors. They'll feel immediately familiar.
</Info>

## First-Time Setup in WhoDB

### Connection Profiles

**In phpMyAdmin**, you typically set up multiple servers in `config.inc.php`.

**In WhoDB**, you can save connection profiles without any configuration files:

<Steps>
<Step title="Click Login Page Setup">
On the first login screen, enter your database details (host, port, username, password)
</Step>
<Step title="Connect">
Click "Connect" to establish connection
</Step>
<Step title="Explore">
WhoDB immediately shows your database structure in the sidebar
</Step>
<Step title="Return Anytime">
You can create multiple profiles by reconnecting with different credentials
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
WhoDB doesn't store credentials by default (more secure), but you can create and save connection profiles for easy reconnection.
</Tip>

### Navigating Your First Database

![Storage Unit List](/images/05-storage-unit-list.png)

When you first connect, you'll see:
- **Sidebar**: Your complete database structure
- **Main Area**: List of tables
- **Top Tabs**: Data, Explore, Graph, Scratchpad

Click any table to start exploring. No separate "browse" step needed.

## Understanding WhoDB's Views

Unlike phpMyAdmin's tab-based system, WhoDB organizes features into distinct views:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Data View" icon="table">
Browse, edit, filter, and sort your table data with modern UX
</Card>
<Card title="Explore View" icon="sitemap">
See table structure, columns, indexes, constraints, and metadata
</Card>
<Card title="Graph View" icon="network">
Visualize your database schema and relationships interactively
</Card>
<Card title="Scratchpad View" icon="code">
Write and execute SQL queries with multi-cell support
</Card>
</CardGroup>

Each view is focused on a specific task, making the interface cleaner than phpMyAdmin's multiple tabs.

## Common phpMyAdmin Tasks in WhoDB

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Add a New Column to a Table">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Go to Explore view
2. Find the table
3. Click "Add Column" button
4. Fill in column details (name, type, constraints)
5. Click "Create"

This is cleaner than phpMyAdmin's complex structure modification dialogs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a New Table">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Use Scratchpad to write CREATE TABLE statement
2. Execute the query
3. Table appears instantly in sidebar

Alternatively, use the UI to create tables (coming in future updates).

**Tip**: This is one area where phpMyAdmin's UI table builder is faster. We're working on improving this in WhoDB.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="View and Edit Stored Procedures">
**In WhoDB:**
Currently, stored procedures are shown in Explore view but must be edited via queries in Scratchpad.

We're adding visual stored procedure editing in upcoming releases.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check User Privileges">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Open Scratchpad
2. Run privilege checking queries:
   - PostgreSQL: `SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_privileges;`
   - MySQL: `SELECT * FROM mysql.user;`
3. Results appear in grid

This requires more SQL knowledge than phpMyAdmin's UI, but it's more transparent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Backup Your Database">
**In WhoDB:**
1. Go to Data view or Scratchpad
2. Export entire table with "Export All" as SQL format
3. Save file as backup

For full database backups, use command-line tools:
```bash
# PostgreSQL
pg_dump dbname > backup.sql

# MySQL
mysqldump -u user -p database > backup.sql
```

WhoDB's export feature is great for quick data backups, but command-line tools are better for full database administration.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What's Different (and Why It's Better)

### No "Structure" Tab Confusion

phpMyAdmin separates data browsing from structure viewing. WhoDB has an **"Explore"** view that shows everything in one intuitive place:
- Column names and types
- Primary keys and indexes
- Constraints and relationships
- All without SQL knowledge

### Instant Multi-Database Access

Instead of selecting from a dropdown, WhoDB's **sidebar shows your entire database structure** at once. Expand schemas, click any table, and view data instantly.

![Storage Unit List With Sidebar](/images/06-storage-unit-list-with-sidebar.png)

### Better Query Organization

phpMyAdmin runs one query at a time. WhoDB's **Scratchpad** lets you write multiple related queries in different cells and run them independently. Perfect for complex workflows.

![Scratchpad Main View](/images/27-scratchpad-main-view.png)

### Visual Relationships

phpMyAdmin requires you to mentally parse foreign keys from `information_schema`. WhoDB's **Graph view** visualizes your entire schema:

![Graph View Schema Topology](/images/24-graph-view-schema-topology.png)

### Smart Filtering Without SQL

phpMyAdmin forces you to write WHERE clauses for filtering. WhoDB's visual filter builder lets you:
- Select field
- Choose operator (=, >, \<, like, etc.)
- Enter value
- Filter applies instantly

Perfect for non-SQL developers and quick ad-hoc queries.

## Phasing Out phpMyAdmin

### Week 1: Parallel Usage
- Keep phpMyAdmin running
- Use WhoDB for all new tasks
- Reference phpMyAdmin when you need something familiar

### Week 2: Explore Advanced Features
- Try Graph visualization
- Practice multi-cell Scratchpad queries
- Experiment with filtering

### Week 3: Go All-In
- Fully switch to WhoDB
- Delete phpMyAdmin from your stack
- Enjoy the simpler, cleaner interface

<Tip>
Most users find WhoDB more intuitive within just a few days. Your muscle memory will switch quickly.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Transition Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I Can't Find the Table Management Features">
**Solution**: Look in the **Explore view** rather than a separate "Structure" tab. Click the table in your sidebar, then click the "Explore" tab to see all table details including columns, indexes, and constraints.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where's My Database Statistics?">
**Solution**: WhoDB displays key stats in the Explore view. For detailed statistics, use the Scratchpad to query system tables:
```sql
-- PostgreSQL
SELECT schemaname, tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename))
FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname != 'information_schema';
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How Do I Use Saved Queries?">
**Solution**: Write queries in the Scratchpad. They're automatically saved to history, which you can access by clicking the "History" button. You can also save query cells and refer back to them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Sidebar Feels Overwhelming">
**Solution**: Click the collapse arrow next to schema names to hide table lists. Use Cmd/Ctrl+/ to toggle the sidebar visibility entirely. You can customize what's visible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I Need to Connect to Multiple Databases">
**Solution**: Create separate browser tabs with different connections. WhoDB supports managing multiple connections simultaneously. Each tab maintains its own session.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
