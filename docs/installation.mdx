## Docker Installation (Recommended)

<Tip>
Docker is the fastest and easiest way to get started with WhoDB
</Tip>

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Access to a database you want to connect to

### Quick Start with Docker

<Steps>
<Step title="Pull the Docker Image">
```bash
docker pull clidey/whodb:latest
```
</Step>
<Step title="Run WhoDB Container">
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name whodb \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  clidey/whodb:latest
```
</Step>
<Step title="Access WhoDB">
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
WhoDB will be accessible on port 8080. You can change the port by modifying the `-p` flag (e.g., `-p 3000:8080` for port 3000)
</Note>

### Docker Compose

For a more robust setup, use Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  whodb:
    image: clidey/whodb:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - WHODB_PORT=8080
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - whodb-data:/data
volumes:
  whodb-data:
```

Save this as `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Binary Installation

<Warning>
Pre-compiled binaries are platform-specific. Make sure to download the correct version for your operating system.
</Warning>

### Download Pre-Compiled Binaries

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Linux">
```bash
# Download the latest Linux binary
curl -L https://github.com/clidey/whodb/releases/latest/download/whodb-linux-amd64 -o whodb

# Make it executable
chmod +x whodb

# Run WhoDB
./whodb
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="macOS">
```bash
# Download the latest macOS binary
curl -L https://github.com/clidey/whodb/releases/latest/download/whodb-darwin-amd64 -o whodb

# Make it executable
chmod +x whodb

# Run WhoDB
./whodb
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Windows">
1. Download `whodb-windows-amd64.exe` from the [releases page](https://github.com/clidey/whodb/releases/latest)
2. Double-click the executable to run WhoDB
3. Access via browser at `http://localhost:8080`
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Build from Source

For developers who want to customize WhoDB or contribute to the project:

### Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Backend Requirements">
- Go 1.21 or higher
- Git
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Frontend Requirements">
- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm package manager
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Build Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/clidey/whodb.git
cd whodb
```
</Step>
<Step title="Build the Frontend">
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run build
cd ..
```
</Step>
<Step title="Build the Backend">
```bash
cd core
go build -o whodb .
```
</Step>
<Step title="Run WhoDB">
```bash
./whodb
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The built binary will embed the frontend assets, creating a single executable file
</Info>

### Development Mode

For active development with hot-reload:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Backend
cd core
go run .
```
```bash Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm start
```
</CodeGroup>

Run both commands in separate terminals. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and will proxy API requests to the backend.

## Configuration Options

WhoDB can be configured using environment variables or command-line flags:

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `WHODB_PORT` | Port to run WhoDB on | `8080` |
| `WHODB_HOST` | Host address to bind to | `0.0.0.0` |
| `WHODB_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) | `info` |
| `WHODB_DISABLE_CREDENTIAL_FORM` | Disable manual DB credential form on the login page; allow login only via preconfigured connections (environment profiles, cloud providers, etc.) | `false` |

### Example with Custom Port

```bash
WHODB_PORT=3000 ./whodb
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e WHODB_PORT=3000 \
  clidey/whodb:latest
```

## Verifying Installation

<Check>
After installation, verify WhoDB is running correctly
</Check>

<Steps>
<Step title="Check the Service">
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or your configured port)
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Login Page">
You should see the WhoDB login page with database connection options
</Step>
<Step title="Test Connection">
Try connecting to a test database to ensure everything works properly
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Port Already in Use">
If port 8080 is already in use, either:
- Stop the service using that port
- Use a different port with `-p 3000:8080` (Docker) or `WHODB_PORT=3000` (binary)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied (Linux/macOS)">
Make sure the binary is executable:
```bash
chmod +x whodb
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Docker Container Exits Immediately">
Check the logs to see what went wrong:
```bash
docker logs whodb
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cannot Connect to Database">
Ensure:
- The database is accessible from WhoDB's network
- Firewall rules allow the connection
- Credentials are correct
- For Docker: use host.docker.internal instead of localhost for databases on the host
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Network Considerations

<Warning>
By default, WhoDB binds to `0.0.0.0`, making it accessible from any network interface. For production deployments, consider:
</Warning>

- Running behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy)
- Enabling HTTPS/TLS
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Restricting network access with firewall rules
- Using a VPN or SSH tunnel for remote access
