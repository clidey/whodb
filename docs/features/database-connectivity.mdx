- **Max Idle Time**: How long idle connections remain open
- **Connection Lifetime**: Maximum time before connection is recycled
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Query Timeout">
Prevent runaway queries from consuming resources:
```text
Query Timeout: 30 seconds (configurable)
```
Queries exceeding this timeout will be cancelled automatically.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Use Strong Credentials">
Always use strong, unique passwords for database users. Never use default passwords like "password" or "admin" in production.

<Warning>
Weak credentials are a leading cause of database breaches.
</Warning>
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Encryption">
Use SSL/TLS for all connections to production databases to encrypt data in transit.
</Step>
<Step title="Create Dedicated Users">
Don't use administrative accounts for routine work. Create dedicated database users with minimal required permissions.

<CodeGroup>
```sql PostgreSQL Read-Only User
CREATE USER whodb_readonly WITH PASSWORD 'strong_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO whodb_readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO whodb_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO whodb_readonly;
```
```sql MySQL Read-Only User
CREATE USER 'whodb_ro'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';
GRANT SELECT ON myapp.* TO 'whodb_ro'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Network Isolation">
Restrict database access to known IP addresses or use VPNs for remote connections. Consider using firewalls and security groups.
</Step>
<Step title="Monitor Connections">
Keep track of who is accessing your databases and when. Review logs regularly for suspicious activity.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Connection Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Connection Refused">
**Symptom**: "Connection refused" or "Unable to connect"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the host and port are correct
2. Ensure the database service is running
3. Check firewall rules allow the connection
4. For Docker containers: use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost`
5. Try connecting with the database's native client tool first (psql, mysql, mongo, etc.)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Authentication Failed">
**Symptom**: "Invalid username or password" or "Access denied"

**Solutions**:
1. Double-check credentials (case-sensitive in many systems)
2. Verify the database user exists and is active
3. Ensure the user has permission to connect from your IP address
4. Check if the user has the correct role/permissions
5. Reset the password using the database administration tools
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Database Not Found">
**Symptom**: "Database does not exist" or "Database not accessible"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the database name (some systems are case-sensitive)
2. Ensure the database has been created
3. Check if the user has permission to access that database
4. For MySQL: database and schema are the same concept
5. For PostgreSQL: verify the database exists with `\l` command
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="SSL Connection Error">
**Symptom**: "SSL certificate error" or "Self-signed certificate error"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify SSL certificates are valid and not expired
2. Ensure certificate paths are correctly specified
3. Try different SSL modes (require → verify-ca → verify-full)
4. For self-signed certificates, use "Require" mode without verification
5. Check if the server certificate matches the hostname
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connection Timeout">
**Symptom**: "Connection timed out" or "Request timeout"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify network connectivity to the database host
2. Check firewall rules and security groups
3. Increase the connection timeout in Advanced Options
4. Ensure the database server is not overloaded
5. Try connecting from a different network location
6. Check for proxy or VPN issues
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="SSH Tunnel Issues">
**Symptom**: "SSH connection failed" or tunnel-related errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify SSH credentials and key file permissions
2. Ensure SSH server is accessible and running
3. Check SSH port (usually 22) is accessible
