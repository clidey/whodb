# AI Chat Assistant - Introduction

WhoDB's AI Chat Assistant revolutionizes database interaction by letting you use natural language instead of SQL. Ask questions in plain English, and the assistant generates accurate queries, executes them, and presents results in an intuitive format.

<Tip>
The AI Chat Assistant is like having an expert database administrator and SQL developer available 24/7
</Tip>

## What is the AI Chat Assistant?

The AI Chat Assistant bridges the gap between human language and database queries. Instead of remembering SQL syntax, table names, or join conditions, you simply describe what you want to know.

## Privacy and Security

### Data Privacy Considerations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="External Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)" icon="cloud">
**What's Sent**: Your database schema and query text
**Not Sent**: Actual database data or query results
**Consideration**: Review your organization's policies on external AI services
</Card>
<Card title="Local Models (Ollama)" icon="server">
**What's Sent**: Nothing—all processing is local
**Privacy**: Complete data isolation
**Consideration**: Ideal for sensitive or regulated environments
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
For highly sensitive data, use local models (Ollama) or consult your security team before enabling external AI providers
</Warning>

## Comparison: Traditional SQL vs. AI Assistant

| Task | Traditional Approach | With AI Assistant |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Find all users | Write `SELECT * FROM users` | Ask "Show me all users" |
| Complex aggregation | Write GROUP BY with multiple joins | Ask "Count orders by product category" |
| Filter by date | Remember date syntax for your database | Ask "Show orders from last month" |
| Debug query | Read error message, fix syntax | Rephrase question naturally |
| Learn schema | Query information_schema tables | Ask "What tables exist?" |
| Data modification | Write UPDATE/DELETE carefully | Describe change, confirm when prompted |

The AI assistant eliminates syntax memorization and reduces the time from question to insight.

## Limitations

While powerful, the AI assistant has some limitations:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Query Complexity">
Extremely complex multi-step operations may require:
- Breaking into multiple queries
- Manual refinement in Scratchpad
- Traditional SQL for edge cases
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Database Permissions">
The assistant respects your database user permissions:
- Cannot perform operations beyond granted privileges
- No elevation of user permissions
- Same access as manual SQL queries
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Response Time">
Query generation depends on:
- AI provider speed
- Network latency (for external providers)
- Database query execution time
- Schema complexity
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Accuracy">
While highly accurate, the assistant may occasionally:
- Misinterpret ambiguous questions
- Generate suboptimal queries for very specific needs
- Require clarification for context-dependent requests

Always review generated SQL for critical operations.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Start specific, then generalize. Instead of "show me the data," ask "show me all users created this month"
</Tip>

Key practices for effective AI assistant use:

1. **Be Specific**: Clear questions get better results
2. **Provide Context**: Mention table names when ambiguous
3. **Verify SQL**: Review generated queries for important operations
4. **Use Confirmation**: Take advantage of modification confirmations
5. **Leverage Context**: Build on previous questions in conversation
6. **Move to Scratchpad**: Save useful queries for reuse
