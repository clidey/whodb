# Batch Operations

WhoDB supports efficient batch operations that allow you to select multiple rows and perform actions on them collectively. This is essential for bulk data management, cleanup, and targeted modifications.

<Tip>
Row selection and batch operations streamline workflows when working with multiple records
</Tip>

## Overview

Batch operations in WhoDB include:

- **Row selection**: Choose one or multiple rows
- **Bulk actions**: Perform operations on selected rows
- **Context menus**: Quick access to batch operations
- **Selective export**: Export only selected rows
- **Bulk deletion**: Delete multiple rows at once

## Row Selection Methods

### Individual Row Selection

Select a single row by clicking its checkbox:

1. Locate the checkbox at the left of any row
2. Click to select that row
3. The row highlights to indicate selection
4. Action buttons appear for the selected row

**Use for**: Targeting specific records for editing or deletion

### Multiple Row Selection

Select multiple rows to perform batch operations:

<Steps>
<Step title="Click first row checkbox">
Click the checkbox for the first row you want to select
</Step>
<Step title="Hold Shift and click last row">
To select a contiguous range of rows, hold Shift and click the last row in your range
</Step>
<Step title="Use Ctrl/Cmd+Click">
To select non-contiguous rows, hold Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) and click additional rows
</Step>
</Steps>

**Result**: Multiple rows are selected and highlighted

<Note>
The selection indicator shows how many rows are currently selected (e.g., "3 rows selected")
</Note>

### Select/Deselect All

Many interfaces include buttons to select or deselect all visible rows:

- **Select All**: Select every row currently displayed
- **Deselect All**: Clear all selections

These are useful for:
- Selecting all rows on the current page
- Selecting all filtered results
- Clearing selections after batch operations

## Context Menu Operations

### Accessing the Context Menu

Right-click on any row to open the context menu:

![Context Menu](/images/38-table-header-context-menu.png)

The context menu shows available actions for that row or selection.

### Select Row Option

![Select Row from Context Menu](/images/45-context-menu-select-row.png)

One option in the context menu is "Select Row" which:

- Selects the clicked row (or toggles selection)
- Prepares the row for batch operations
- Works alongside other selected rows

## Batch Actions

### Available Batch Operations

After selecting rows, several batch operations become available:

#### Export Selected Rows

Export only the rows you've selected:

![Export Selected Rows Mode](/images/46-export-selected-rows-mode.png)

<Steps>
<Step title="Select rows">
Choose one or multiple rows using checkboxes
</Step>
<Step title="Click Export">
Access the export function from the action bar
</Step>
<Step title="Choose Export Selected">
Select the "Export Selected" option in the dialog
</Step>
<Step title="Select format">
Choose CSV, Excel, JSON, or SQL format
</Step>
<Step title="Download">

Confirm rows were deleted
</Step>
</Steps>

**Example workflow**:
- Filter to status = 'inactive'
- Select all inactive users (Ctrl+A or Select All button)
- Delete selected rows to clean up old accounts

**Safety tip**: Always create an export backup before bulk deletion

#### Update Multiple Rows

Update a field value across multiple selected rows:

While individual row editing works on one row at a time, this workflow applies changes to multiple selected rows:

<Steps>
<Step title="Select rows to update">
Choose rows that need the same change
</Step>
<Step title="Access bulk edit">
Right-click context menu or action bar option
</Step>
<Step title="Select field to update">
Choose which column to modify
</Step>
<Step title="Enter new value">
Provide the new value for all selected rows
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm">
Apply the change to all selected rows
</Step>
</Steps>

**Example scenarios**:
- Change status from 'pending' to 'approved' for multiple rows
- Update last_reviewed date for a group of records
- Mark multiple items as 'inactive'

## Real-World Batch Operation Workflows

### Cleaning Up Old Data

Remove records that meet cleanup criteria:

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter old records">
Use WHERE conditions: created_at < '2020-01-01' AND status = 'deleted'
</Step>
<Step title="Export for backup">
Export filtered results to CSV for archive
</Step>
<Step title="Select all filtered rows">
Use Select All button on filtered results
</Step>
<Step title="Delete selected rows">
Remove all selected rows
</Step>
<Step title="Verify deletion">
Confirm count decreased and backups were saved
</Step>
</Steps>

**Result**: Clean database with archived backups

### Bulk Status Updates

Update multiple records to reflect a new state:

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter to target records">
Use WHERE conditions: status = 'pending' AND created_at < '2024-09-01'
</Step>
<Step title="Select filtered rows">
Click Select All to choose all pending items
</Step>
<Step title="Batch update status">
Change status to 'archived' for all selected
</Step>
<Step title="Verify updates">
Filter again to confirm change took effect
</Step>
</Steps>

**Result**: Multiple records updated efficiently

### Data Export and Analysis

Extract specific record sets for external analysis:

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter to relevant data">
Use WHERE conditions: department = 'Sales' AND year = 2024
</Step>
<Step title="Select filtered rows">
Select all results or specific rows
</Step>
<Step title="Export selected rows">
Choose Excel format for spreadsheet analysis
</Step>
<Step title="Download file">
Save to computer for further analysis
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze externally">
Use Excel, Tableau, or other tools
</Step>
</Steps>

**Result**: Sales department data in Excel ready for analysis

### Archival Workflow

Move large amounts of old data out of active tables:

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify old records">
Filter by: created_at < '2023-01-01'
</Step>
<Step title="Export for archive">
Export all matching rows to JSON/SQL for backup
</Step>
<Step title="Store securely">
Save backup file to archive location
</Step>
<Step title="Delete from active table">
Select filtered rows and delete
</Step>
<Step title="Verify results">
Confirm counts and backups succeeded
</Step>
</Steps>

**Result**: Smaller active table with archived data safely backed up

## Selection Best Practices

### Clear Selection Before New Operations

Always clear selections between operations:

1. After completing an action with selected rows
2. Before starting a different batch operation
3. Click "Deselect All" or Select All then Deselect

This prevents accidental operations on stale selections.

### Verify Before Destructive Operations

For deletion and bulk updates:

<Accordion title="Verification Checklist">
- [ ] Correct rows are selected (spot check a few)
- [ ] Selection count matches expectation
- [ ] Backup or export completed (for deletion)
- [ ] No important data in selected rows
- [ ] Confirmation dialog shown and read carefully
- [ ] Ready to proceed with operation
</Accordion>

### Use Filters with Selection

Combine filtering and selection for precision:

<Steps>
<Step title="Apply WHERE conditions">
Narrow to specific data subset
</Step>
<Step title="Review filtered results">
Verify filter caught intended rows
</Step>
<Step title="Select appropriate rows">
Choose all matching rows or specific subset
</Step>
<Step title="Perform operation">
Execute batch operation on selection
</Step>
</Steps>

**Example**: Filter to inactive users (status = 'inactive'), select all, then delete

### Selective vs. All Selection

Choose the right approach:

### Select All (Fast)

Use when:
- All visible/filtered rows need the same operation
- You've already filtered to the correct subset
- Time is critical and accuracy confirmed

```
Filter → Select All → Export/Delete → Done
```

Advantages: Speed, simplicity

---

### Selective Selection (Safe)

Use when:
- Only some rows need the operation
- Criteria are complex or varied
- High cost of mistake (important data)

```
Manually select → Spot check → Operation → Verify
```

Advantages: Precision, control, safety


## Advanced Selection Scenarios

### A/B Testing Data

Select test and control groups separately:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create test group">
Filter to user_id % 2 = 0, select half
</Step>
<Step title="Export test group">
Export selected rows to CSV
</Step>
<Step title="Create control group">
Filter different criteria, select other half
</Step>
<Step title="Export control group">
Export to separate CSV for comparison
</Step>
</Steps>

### Progressive Processing

Handle large datasets in batches:

1. Filter to first 100 rows (pagination or date range)
2. Select and process
3. Move to next batch
4. Repeat until complete

Prevents overwhelming single operations on huge datasets.

### Anomaly Investigation

Select unusual records for analysis:

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter anomalies">
WHERE amount > expected_max OR status = 'error'
</Step>
<Step title="Select anomalous rows">
Select all or specific outliers
</Step>
<Step title="Export for investigation">
Export with all related fields
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze externally">
Investigate in spreadsheet or custom tool
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Selection Seems Stuck

**Issue**: Selections not responding to new clicks

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the page (Cmd/Ctrl + R)
2. Click elsewhere first, then try again
3. Clear selections with Deselect All
4. Restart the batch operation

### Wrong Rows Selected

**Issue**: Selected rows don't match what you intended

**Solution**:
1. Click Deselect All to start fresh
2. Verify filter is correct
3. Manually reselect rows carefully
4. Use spot checks before confirming action

### Batch Operation Didn't Complete

**Issue**: Export or delete seemed to work but nothing happened

**Solution**:
1. Refresh page to see current state
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify selection wasn't cleared
4. Try operation again with fewer rows

### Performance Issues with Large Selection

**Issue**: Interface slows down with hundreds of selected rows

**Solution**:
1. Process in smaller batches
2. Break operation into multiple passes
3. Clear selections between passes
4. Contact support if persists

## Security Considerations

### Batch Operation Audit Trail

All batch operations are logged:

- **What**: Which rows were affected
- **When**: Timestamp of operation
- **Who**: User account performing operation
- **Type**: Delete, update, export
- **Count**: Number of rows affected

### Access Control

Batch operations respect database permissions:

- Users can only select/modify rows they have access to
- Deletions are logged for compliance
- Exports are auditable for data governance
- Consider read-only accounts for sensitive data

<Warning>
Always verify you have proper authorization before performing batch deletions or exports on production databases
</Warning>

## Summary

Batch operations provide:

- Efficient row selection (single, multiple, all)
- Context menu access to bulk actions
- Selective and bulk export capabilities
- Safe deletion with verification
- Audit trails for compliance
- Integration with filtering for precision

Master batch operations to efficiently manage large datasets, perform bulk updates, and export precisely the data you need—while maintaining data integrity and security.
