# Advanced Filtering with Where Conditions

WhoDB's WHERE conditions feature enables sophisticated data filtering through a visual interface. Build complex queries without writing SQL, or combine conditions to extract exactly the data you need.

<Tip>
WHERE conditions are the foundation of effective data exploration and targeted exports
</Tip>

## Overview

The WHERE conditions interface allows you to:

- Apply single or multiple filters
- Use various comparison operators
- Combine conditions with AND/OR logic
- Build complex queries visually
- Save and reuse filter presets

## Basic Filtering

### Opening the Filter Interface

1. Navigate to any table in WhoDB
2. Click the **Filter** button in the action bar (funnel icon)
3. The WHERE conditions popover opens

The interface shows an empty filter state ready for your first condition.

### Creating Your First Condition

<Steps>
<Step title="Select a Column">
Click the field dropdown to choose which column to filter

![Where Field Dropdown](/images/18-data-view-where-field-dropdown.png)

All available columns in the table are shown in the list.
</Step>
<Step title="Choose an Operator">
Select the comparison operator for your condition (e.g., =, >, \<)

Available operators depend on the column's data type.
</Step>
<Step title="Enter a Value">
Type or select the value to compare against
</Step>
<Step title="Apply Filter">
Click "Apply" or "Done" to filter the table
</Step>
</Steps>

The table instantly updates to show only matching rows.

## Comparison Operators

WhoDB supports various operators for different filter scenarios:

### Equality Operators

#### Equals (=)

![Equals Operator](/images/59-where-operator-equals.png)

Exact match filter. Returns rows where the column value exactly matches your input.

**Use for**:
- Exact category matching (status = 'active')
- Finding specific users by ID
- Filtering by exact date or timestamp

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
```

<Note>
Case-sensitive for text fields on most databases
</Note>

#### Not Equals (!=)

![Not Equals Operator](/images/62-where-operator-not-equals.png)

Inverse match. Returns all rows EXCEPT those matching the value.

**Use for**:
- Excluding specific categories (status != 'deleted')
- Finding inactive records
- Filtering out placeholder values

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status != 'archived'
```

**Example Results**:
- Row 1: status = 'active' ✓ (included)
- Row 2: status = 'inactive' ✓ (included)
- Row 3: status = 'deleted' ✗ (excluded)

### Comparison Operators

#### Greater Than (>)

![Greater Than Operator](/images/60-where-operator-greater-than.png)

Returns rows where the column value is strictly greater than the specified value.

**Use for**:
- Age > 18 (find adults)
- price > 100 (expensive items)
- created_at > '2024-01-01' (recent records)

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 50
```

#### Less Than (\<)

![Less Than Operator](/images/61-where-operator-less-than.png)

Returns rows where the column value is strictly less than the specified value.

**Use for**:
- inventory < 10 (low stock alert)
- age < 18 (minors)
- discount < 0.5 (discounts under 50%)

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE inventory < 10
```

#### Greater Than or Equal (>=)

![Greater Than or Equal Operator](/images/63-where-operator-greater-than-equal.png)

Inclusive greater than comparison.

**Use for**:
- age >= 18 (18 and older)
- score >= 80 (passing grades)
- created_at >= '2024-10-01' (October or later)

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE total >= 100
```

#### Less Than or Equal (\<=)

![Less Than or Equal Operator](/images/64-where-operator-less-than-equal.png)

Inclusive less than comparison.

**Use for**:
- discount \<= 0.3 (30% discount or less)
- attempts \<= 3 (three or fewer attempts)
- deadline \<= '2024-12-31' (by year end)

```sql
SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE deadline <= '2024-12-31'
```

## Working with Multiple Conditions

### Adding More Conditions

Click **Add Condition** to add additional filters. Multiple conditions are combined with AND logic by default.

![Multiple Where Conditions](/images/40-data-view-multiple-where-conditions.png)

**AND Logic**: All conditions must be true
```sql
WHERE status = 'active' AND age > 18
```

Only rows where status IS 'active' AND age IS greater than 18 are shown.

### Condition Logic

### AND Conditions

**All conditions must be satisfied**

```sql
WHERE status = 'active' AND created_at > '2024-01-01'
```

**Result**: Shows only active users created after Jan 1, 2024

Use AND when you want to narrow results and require multiple criteria.

**Example Scenarios**:
- Active users who registered in 2024
- Products priced over $50 with inventory > 10
- Orders placed this month and not yet shipped

---

### OR Conditions

**At least one condition must be satisfied**

When filtering within a single column, OR logic can show alternatives:

```sql
WHERE status = 'active' OR status = 'pending'
```

**Result**: Shows users with either active or pending status

Use OR to broaden results and show alternative options.

**Example Scenarios**:
- Show users with active or trial status
- Products in category A OR category B
- Orders shipped OR in-progress (exclude pending)

</Step>
</Steps>

**Result**: Identifies users to re-engage or remove

### Inventory Management

**Low stock items that need reordering**

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter by inventory">
Set quantity \<= 10
</Step>
<Step title="Filter by status">
Set status != 'discontinued'
</Step>
</Steps>

**Result**: List of in-stock items needing replenishment

### Financial Analysis

</Step>
<Step title="Filter by date end">
Set created_at \<= '2024-12-31'
</Step>
</Steps>

**Result**: High-value Q4 2024 orders

### Content Management

**Published posts by a specific author**

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter by status">
Set status = 'published'
</Step>
<Step title="Filter by author">
Set author = 'Sarah Johnson'
</Step>
<Step title="Filter by date">
Set created_at > '2024-01-01'
</Step>
</Steps>

**Result**: All published content from this author in 2024

## Advanced Filtering Patterns

### Date Range Filtering

Filter for records within a specific time period:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add start date condition">
Set created_at >= '2024-01-01'
</Step>
<Step title="Add end date condition">
Set created_at < '2024-12-31'
</Step>
</Steps>

```sql
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01' AND created_at < '2024-12-31'
```

### Numeric Range Filtering

Filter for values within a range:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add minimum condition">
Set price >= 50
</Step>
<Step title="Add maximum condition">
Set price \<= 200
</Step>
</Steps>

```sql
WHERE price >= 50 AND price \<= 200
```

**Use cases**: Price ranges, age brackets, score thresholds

### Exclusion Patterns

Show everything EXCEPT specific items:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add exclusion condition">
Set status != 'archived'
</Step>
<Step title="Add another exclusion">
Set deleted_at IS NULL
</Step>
</Steps>

```sql
WHERE status != 'archived' AND deleted_at IS NULL
```

### Combining Categories

Show records from multiple categories:

Since visual interface uses AND, you'd typically show one category at a time. For multiple categories, use SQL mode:

```sql
WHERE category = 'Electronics' OR category = 'Computers'
```

## Filter Indicators and Status

### Active Filter Display

When filters are applied, the filter button shows a badge indicating the number of active conditions.

![Where Conditions Badge](/images/19-data-view-where-conditions-badge.png)

- **1 condition**: One filter is active
- **2+ conditions**: Multiple filters applied
- **No badge**: No filters active (showing all data)

### Row Count Changes

Notice how the table updates instantly when you apply or modify filters. The page count and total row display changes to reflect filtered results.

## Saving and Reusing Filters

<Tip>
Save frequently used filter combinations for quick access
</Tip>

### Saving a Filter Set

After creating a useful set of conditions:

1. Complete your filter configuration
2. Click **Save Filter** (if available)
3. Give it a descriptive name
4. Access it later from the saved filters list

### Common Saved Filters

Examples of filter sets worth saving:

- **Active Users**: status = 'active'
- **Recent Orders**: created_at > current_date - 30 days
- **Overdue Tasks**: status = 'pending' AND due_date < current_date
- **High Priority**: priority = 'high' AND status != 'completed'
- **Q4 2024 Revenue**: date >= '2024-10-01' AND date \<= '2024-12-31'

## Exporting Filtered Data

After applying filters, you can export only the filtered results:

<Steps>
<Step title="Apply filters">
Use WHERE conditions to narrow your data
</Step>
<Step title="Open Export">
Click the Export button
</Step>
<Step title="Choose Export Filtered">
Select the "Export Filtered" option
</Step>
<Step title="Select Format">
Choose CSV, Excel, JSON, or SQL
</Step>
<Step title="Download">
Get your filtered data in desired format
</Step>
</Steps>

This is perfect for:
- Exporting quarterly reports (filtered by date)
- Sharing specific customer data (filtered by status)
- Creating demo datasets (filtered to relevant records)

## Performance Considerations

### Filtering Large Tables

<Accordion title="Tips for Large Datasets">
**Use Specific Filters**: More specific conditions execute faster
- Good: status = 'active' AND created_at > '2024-01-01'
- Slow: status NOT IN ('deleted', 'archived', 'inactive')

**Filter Early**: Apply restrictions before other operations
- Apply WHERE conditions before sorting
- Filter before searching
- Paginate filtered results

**Avoid Full Table Scans**: Don't filter on unindexed columns if possible
- Indexed columns: id, status, created_at (usually)
- Unindexed columns: arbitrary text fields
- Check your Explore tab for index information
</Accordion>

### Complex Query Alternatives

For very complex filtering beyond the visual interface:

1. Switch to **Scratchpad** SQL editor
2. Write custom SQL with complex logic
3. Use subqueries, JOINs, and window functions
4. Export results as needed

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE status = 'active'
  AND created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
  AND user_id IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM orders
    WHERE total > 100
    GROUP BY user_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
  )
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Start Simple, Add Complexity">
Begin with one condition, verify results, then add more. This helps you understand data and debug issues.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Use Appropriate Operators">
Choose the right operator for your data type:
- Text: Equals, Not Equals
- Numbers: Range operators (>=, \<=)
- Dates: Range and comparison operators
- Booleans: Equals for true/false
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Verify Results Make Sense">
After applying filters, scan the results to ensure they match your expectations. Mismatches reveal data issues.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Document Complex Filters">
If using complex conditions, save them with clear names or note them for reproducibility.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Combine with Search">
Use WHERE conditions for structured filtering and Search for text pattern matching—they complement each other.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Filter Returns No Results

**Cause**: Conditions too restrictive or values don't exist

**Solution**:
1. Remove one condition to see if results appear
2. Verify the value you're filtering for exists
3. Check for case sensitivity (text fields)
4. Use the table preview to verify data

### Results Don't Match Expectations

**Cause**: Misunderstanding of operator behavior

**Solution**:
1. Clear filters and start fresh
2. Apply one condition at a time
3. Verify each step matches expectations
4. Check if AND/OR logic is correct

### Slow Filtering Performance

**Cause**: Large dataset or unoptimized query

**Solution**:
1. Use more specific filter values
2. Add date ranges to narrow results
3. Filter on indexed columns
4. Check database indexes in Explore view

### Need Complex Logic

**Alternative**: Switch to Scratchpad SQL editor for advanced queries
