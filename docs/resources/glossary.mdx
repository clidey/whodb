</Tip>

## A

**Aggregate Function**
A SQL function that performs calculations across multiple rows and returns a single value. Common examples include COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX(). These functions are typically used with GROUP BY clauses to summarize data.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
A set of rules and tools for building software applications. WhoDB exposes functionality through a GraphQL API, allowing external applications and integrations to interact with database operations programmatically.

**Auto-Increment**
A database feature that automatically generates unique numeric values for a column, typically used for primary keys. Each new row receives the next sequential number without manual intervention.

**Alias**
An alternative name given to a table, column, or subquery in SQL, typically using the AS keyword. Aliases improve query readability and are essential when working with self-joins or multiple tables.

## B

**Backup**
A complete copy of database data created for recovery purposes. WhoDB's export features allow you to create backups in various formats (SQL, CSV, Excel) for data protection and migration.

**Batch Operation**
Processing multiple database records in a single transaction or operation, rather than individually. WhoDB supports batch operations for adding, editing, and deleting multiple rows efficiently.

**Boolean**
A data type that stores one of two values: TRUE or FALSE. Used for binary decisions and flags in databases, often represented as 1 or 0 in some systems.

## C

**Cardinality**
The relationship type between two tables in a database schema, describing how many records in one table can relate to records in another. Common cardinalities include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

**Cascade**
A referential integrity constraint that automatically propagates changes (updates or deletes) from parent to child records. When a parent row is deleted, CASCADE delete removes all related child rows.

**Chat Feature**
WhoDB's AI-powered natural language interface for querying databases. Users can describe their data needs in plain language, and the AI translates them into SQL queries or provides schema insights.

**ClickHouse**
An open-source columnar database management system optimized for analytical queries and real-time data. Supported in WhoDB for handling large volumes of time-series data and analytics workloads.

**Column**
A vertical structure in a table representing a specific attribute of data. Each column has a name and data type, defining what kind of values it can store.

**Composite Key**
A primary key consisting of two or more columns together. Used when a single column cannot uniquely identify rows, requiring a combination of columns for uniqueness.

**Constraint**
A rule applied to database columns or tables to enforce data integrity. Common constraints include PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK constraints.

**Connection Pool**
A collection of reusable database connections managed by WhoDB to improve performance. Rather than creating new connections for each operation, connections are reused when available.

**CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**
A plain-text file format for storing tabular data where rows are separated by newlines and columns by commas. WhoDB supports both importing and exporting data in CSV format.

## D

**Data Type**
A classification that specifies what kind of data a column can store, such as INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, BOOLEAN, or JSON. Data types ensure data integrity and optimize storage.

**Database**
An organized collection of structured data stored in a database management system. WhoDB supports connecting to multiple databases across different database engines.

**Database Engine**
The underlying software system that manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Examples include PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.

**DBeaver**

**DELETE**
A SQL statement that removes one or more rows from a table based on specified conditions. In WhoDB, deletions can be performed via the data grid interface or Scratchpad queries.

**Delimiter**
A character used to separate fields or values, most commonly a comma in CSV files. WhoDB allows customization of delimiters when exporting or importing data.

## E

**Elasticsearch**
A distributed search and analytics engine built on top of Apache Lucene. Supported in WhoDB for searching and analyzing large volumes of unstructured data.

**Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**
A method of visually representing database structures showing entities (tables) and their relationships. WhoDB's Graph view provides an interactive ER diagram of your database schema.

**Export**
The process of extracting data from WhoDB in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL) for use in other applications or for backup purposes.

**Explore View**
One of WhoDB's primary views that displays detailed information about a table's structure including columns, data types, indexes, primary keys, and foreign key relationships.

## F

**Filter**
A mechanism to restrict which rows are displayed based on specified criteria. WhoDB supports filtering via the search box and WHERE condition builders.

**Foreign Key**
A column or combination of columns that references a primary key in another table, enforcing referential integrity and establishing relationships between tables.

**Format Query**
WhoDB's feature to automatically reorganize and indent SQL code for improved readability using keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F.
