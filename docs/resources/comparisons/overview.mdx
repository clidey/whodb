Yes, and many teams do. Common combinations:

- **WhoDB + pgAdmin**: WhoDB for daily work, pgAdmin for advanced PostgreSQL tasks
- **WhoDB + DBeaver**: WhoDB for common databases, DBeaver for specialized ones
- **WhoDB + CLI tools**: WhoDB for visual work, CLI for scripting

WhoDB doesn't lock you in - use it alongside other tools as needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which tool is best for beginners?">
**WhoDB** has the lowest learning curve. New users become productive in minutes.

**TablePlus** is also beginner-friendly with its clean, native interface.

**Avoid** pgAdmin and DBeaver for beginners - these tools have steep learning curves and can be overwhelming.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which tool is best for teams?">
**WhoDB** is ideal for teams because:
- Web-based access (no installation required)
- Consistent experience across platforms
- Easy to deploy centrally
- No per-user licensing costs
- Quick onboarding

**DBeaver Enterprise** is good for large teams with diverse database needs and dedicated training.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need the paid version of any tool?">
**For most users, no.** Free versions of WhoDB, phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin, and DBeaver cover 90%+ of use cases.

Consider paid versions if you need:
- **DBeaver Enterprise**: NoSQL databases, cloud databases, team collaboration

Try free versions first. You'll know when you need paid features.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What about security?">
All tools can be secured properly with:
- SSL/TLS connections
- Strong authentication
- Network restrictions
- Regular updates

**Self-hosted tools (WhoDB, phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin)** give you complete control over security.
