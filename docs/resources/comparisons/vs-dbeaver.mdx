## Migration from DBeaver to WhoDB

If you're considering switching:

<Steps>
<Step title="Evaluate Your Use Cases">
- What percentage of time do you need advanced features?
- Do you use niche databases?

Install WhoDB while keeping DBeaver. Use WhoDB for common tasks, DBeaver for specialized work.
</Step>

<Step title="Assess Team Impact">
Train team on WhoDB. Measure productivity gains. Typically 20-30% faster for daily work.
</Step>

<Step title="Decide on Approach">
- **Full switch:** If you don't need DBeaver's databases
- **Hybrid:** Keep both (many teams do this)
- **Niche tools:** Specialize each tool

Most teams choose hybrid approach.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can WhoDB replace DBeaver for me?">
If you work exclusively with common databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis), absolutely. If you need databases DBeaver supports that WhoDB doesn't, keep DBeaver. Many teams use both effectively.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does WhoDB have all of DBeaver's features?">
No. DBeaver has more advanced query tools, more export formats, visual query builder, and more database support. WhoDB focuses on the 95% of features most users actually need, making them faster and simpler.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the performance difference in real terms?">
For a developer checking 10 tables: DBeaver takes 3-5 minutes (including startup time), WhoDB takes 30-45 seconds. Over a day's work, WhoDB saves 1-2 hours from startup and switching alone.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use WhoDB and DBeaver together?">
Yes, absolutely. Many teams do exactly this. Use WhoDB for speed with common databases, DBeaver for niche databases or specialized work. Complementary tools.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is WhoDB as reliable as DBeaver?">
Both are production-ready and reliable. DBeaver is more mature (longer history). WhoDB is actively developed and used by thousands. Pick based on features needed, not reliability concerns.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What about offline usage?">
DBeaver works offline after installation (desktop app). WhoDB requires server and browser connection. If you frequently work offline, DBeaver is necessary. For most remote work with internet, WhoDB is fine.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Start with WhoDB Community Edition (free) for your primary databases. If you discover you need DBeaver's specific features, add it to your toolkit. Many successful teams use both strategically.
